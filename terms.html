        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using WeightBuddy ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>WeightBuddy is a personal health and wellness application that helps users track their food intake, exercise, and weight. The App uses voice input, AI-powered food and exercise parsing, and provides spoken feedback to create a simple, accessible experience.</p>

        <h2>3. Not Medical Advice</h2>
        <p><strong>WeightBuddy is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice.</strong> The calorie estimates, nutritional information, and exercise calorie burn calculations are approximations only. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any diet or exercise programme, especially if you have existing health conditions.</p>

        <h2>4. Account Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be at least 16 years of age to use the App.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
            <li>You agree to provide accurate information when creating your profile.</li>

            <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to our servers or other users' data.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>6. Calorie & Nutritional Estimates</h2>
        <p>All calorie counts and nutritional estimates provided by the App are <strong>approximations</strong> generated by AI. They should not be relied upon for medical, dietary, or clinical purposes. Actual nutritional values may vary. WeightBuddy rounds calorie estimates to the nearest 50 calories for simplicity.</p>

        <h2>7. Voice & Data Processing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice recordings are temporarily processed for transcription and are not stored permanently.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including its design, code, features, and content, is the property of WeightBuddy and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute any part of the App without our written permission.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, WeightBuddy and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to health outcomes based on calorie or exercise estimates.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the App. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
